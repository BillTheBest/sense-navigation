## Purpose and Description

The Visualization Extension **_sense-navigation_** for Qlik Sense allows you to add a button to a Qlik Sense sheet to navigate in your app:

* Jump to the next sheet
* Jump to the previous sheet
* Jump to a specific sheet
* Jump to a story
* Open a website

The button can be easily styled nicely by selecting some of the predefined designs.

Furthermore **_sense-navigation_** offers the option to define up to two basic actions which will be executed before the navigation happens. The following actions are possible:

* Clear all selections
* Unlock all selections
* Clear selections of a field
* Select a value in a field
* Set a variable value
* Apply a bookmark
