## Purpose and Description

The Visualization Extension **_sense-navigation_** for Qlik Sense allows you to add a button to a Qlik Sense sheet to navigate in your app:

* Jump to the next sheet
* Jump to the previous sheet
* Jump to a specific sheet
* Jump to a story
* Open a website

The button can be easily styled nicely by selecting some of the predefined designs.

Furthermore **_sense-navigation_** offers the option to define up to two basic actions which will be executed before the navigation happens. The following actions are possible:

* Clear all selections
* Unlock all selections
* Clear selections of a field
* Select a value in a field
* Set a variable value
* Apply a bookmark

## Screenshots

### Navigation Behavior

Define the behavior of the button. The following options are available:

> [![](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/blob/master/docs/images/sense_navigation_behavior.png)](#button-icons)

* Go to the next sheet
* Go to the previous sheet
* Go to a specific sheet (if selected you'll see a list of sheets you can select from)
* Go to a story (if selected you'll see a list of stories you can select from)
* Open website (if selected, you'll have to enter the URL in the appearing text box)

### Actions

You can furthermore define up to two action which will be executed before the navigation behavior will be performed.

First enable this option:

> [![](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/blob/master/docs/images/sense_navigation_actions_enable.png)](#installation)

Then select from the list of predefined actions:

> [![](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/blob/master/docs/images/sense_navigation_actions.png)](#configuration)

Depending on the selected action you'll see additional settings you can define, e.g. define the name of a variable and its value:

> [![](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/blob/master/docs/images/sense_navigation_actions_settings.png)](#layout)

As soon as you have defined the first action, you will also be able to define a second action.
