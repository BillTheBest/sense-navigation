The Visualization Extension sense-sheet-navigation for Qlik Sense allows you to add a button to a Qlik Sense sheet to:

* Jump to the next sheet
* Jump to the previous sheet
* Jump to a specific sheet (either a selected one or defined by Id)

It can be easily styled by selecting some of the predefined designs and you can add some basic actions, which will be executed before you jump to another sheet:

* Clear all selections
* Unlock all selections
* Clear selections of a field
* Select a value in a field
* Apply a bookmark
* Set a variable value
* etc.
