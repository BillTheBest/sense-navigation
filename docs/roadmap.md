There are some features I'd like to implement in the near future:

* Allow to add **additional styles for the button** (very similar to [sense-themable-kpi-tile](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-themable-kpi-tile))
* **Additional actions**, e.g.
	* Reload the app
	* Opening another app and pass the current selections to the app (similar to "document chaining in QlikViw")

Is there **anything else you'd like to see** in this visualization extension?

* Don't hesitate to add the feature and create a pull request!
* You don't have the time or skills to implement this specific feature? No problem, [drop a note here]({%= bugs.url %}).
